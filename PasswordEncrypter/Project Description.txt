Password Encrypter:
Software to encrypt and store passwords locally using a single master password. Also generates new passwords if requested. Can autotype usernames and passwords for the user

How to use:
Save info under a name, info is considered at least a password but can also include a username, must enter in a key that the info will be encrypted with (the key is the master password)
When adding info if you do not want to make your own password, leaving the password field as is will have it auto generate a password
You can tweak settings on the auto generation so it will include/disclude numbers or special characters, can also adjust character limit

Once you have info saved then you can enter in your key and it will present you with all your info names
You can select an info name and load up the username, password, or both, and after a few seconds it will type it out for you
If you want to remove info you can do so by selecting it and clicking the 'delete info' button

This software is very simple to use and easy to load up your passwords quickly, so long as you are the one who saved them

Encrytion:
The saved info is encrypted using the Windows system security cryptography library
The key for decryption is just the master password that the user sets when adding saved info to the database
All the encrypted data is saved in a text file in the same folder as the .exe for the program
