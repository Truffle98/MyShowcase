Reinforcement Learning Creature:
The intent of this project was to train a model using reinforcement learning techniques that can walk around a 2d plane, and using it's visual input, locate a white dot known as the 'prey'

Environment Description:
The environment is in a 20x20 2d plane, the middle being 0,0 and going out 10 in every direction
The environment consists 16 green dots or 'foliage', spread equally around the start, same locations every time
The prey will spawn at a random location each time, but minimum 5 units away in both x and y
If you want to experience the environment run the hunting environment file and you can control it using wasd and look for the prey. Press q to quit
The environment feeds it view to the model through a 64x32 pixel image, and also the model will be fed it's recent actions
The environment's setup can be changed at the top of the huntingEnvironment file if you wish to edit it

Graphics Engine:
The graphics are run by calculating the location of objects relative to the camera using functions I made in the HuntingEnvironment class
Once the locations are calculated, then I use the openCV2 circle function to draw them with their proper size and location

AI model:
The AI model is a DQN Agent using Tensorflow, using different models that can vary from agent to agent depending on the settings
The hyperparameters can be adjusted at the top of the hunterTrainer file, including the parameters of the DQN's model

Training your own model:
After changing the hyperparameters you can just run the file to have it train
At the end it will ask if you want to watch and then save the model, entering 'no' will stop these from happening
After you save the model with a name run the policyLoader file, then enter the name of your model to see it again
I have included a very well trained model named 'Double Foliage Circle' if you would like to see a working model
All models are saved with a note about their hyperparams so if you would like to see my model's params feel free to open it's policy stats file
